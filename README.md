### Log

**September 8th**
Tasks completed today:
- Project board created. Made a Kanban board of tasks and requirement specifications. More will be added as I go along.
- Sketched project. Made a map of the different views and components I will use in Figma. 
- Project created. Made a GitHub repo, cloned it, installed dependencies, created views and components.
- Version handling. Created a dev branch.

To do:
- Create API. I've taken a database from an earlier project ([shopping-assignment](https://github.com/Vicachu42/shopping-assignment)), now I need to get more info how to make it into an API that works for this project
- Finish sketch how the page is supposed to look. Will model after [sumo.or.jp](https://www.sumo.or.jp/En/).
- Start testing simpler components that aren't dependant on API.
